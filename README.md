# ONVIF-java
ONVIF library, forked from https://onvif-java-lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ at revision 41


I wanted to use the onvif-java-lib from a small onvif manager project which
is using maven and as no prebuilt artifacts were available, it seemed like
the easiest solution to simply pull in all the code and add a pom file.
